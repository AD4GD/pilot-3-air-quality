variables:
  Particulate Matter (2.5µm):
    description: The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and and the CAMHS Air Quality Forecast.
    units: µg m^-3
  Particulate Matter (10µm):
    description: The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and and the CAMHS Air Quality Forecast.
    units: µg m^-3
