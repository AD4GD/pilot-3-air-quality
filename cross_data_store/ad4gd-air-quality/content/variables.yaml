variables:
  "Particulate Matter (<2.5µm)":
    description: The mass concentration of fine particulate matter (particles with a aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and the CAMS Europe Air Quality Forecast.
    units: µg m^-3
  "Particulate Matter (<10µm)":
    description: The mass concentration of coarse particulate matter (particles with a aerodynamic diameter of 10 micrometers or less) present in the ambient air. Values are derived from a mixture of data from low cost sensors and the CAMS Europe Air Quality Forecast.
    units: µg m^-3
