SDS011:
  name: SDS011
  manufacturer: Nova Fitness
  description: |
    This is the specification for the SDS011. One should not consider all those values for granted as there is quite often a big difference
     between what is said to be possible and what is actually possible (and this is why we are setting up all our experiments).

      Output: PM2.5, PM10
      Measuring Range: 0.0-999.9μg/m3
      Response Time 1 second
      Serial Data Output Frequency: 1 time/second
      Particle Diameter Resolution: ≤0.3μm
      Relative Error:10%
      Temperature Range:-20~50°C
    
    Note that the SDS011 humidity working range is 0-70%. This is so good, since above 70% humidity, the readings become unreliable.

BME280:
  name: BME280
  manufacturer: Bosch
  description: | 
    This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring humidity with ±3% accuracy,
    barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude,
    and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter or better accuracy!

DHT22:
  name: DHT22
  manufacturer: various
  description: |
    The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure
    the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It's fairly simple to use but requires
    careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using
    our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

    Low cost
    Good for 0-100% humidity readings with 2-5% accuracy
    Good for -40 to 80°C temperature readings ±0.5°C accuracy
    No more than 0.5 Hz sampling rate (once every 2 seconds)

PMS1003:
  name: PMS1003
  manufacturer: Plantower
  description: | 
    The PMS 1003 Sensor is a recent laser based Air Quality Sensor developped by plantower (chinese name: 攀藤 (pānténg))
    and used inside a numerous number of air quality sensing devices. It is also sometimes refered as HK 5001, or labelled
    under the "oneair" brand, but it is indeed developped and produced by plantower (a Shenzhen based company with office in Beijing).

    Measuring range: 0.3 to 1.0, 1.0 ~ 2.5, 2.5 to 10 microns (um)
    Range: 0 ~ 500 ug / m3
    counting accuracy of 50% @ 0.3um, 98% @ ≥0.5 um said the quasi-volume : 0.1 liters (L)
    Response time: ≤10 seconds (s)
