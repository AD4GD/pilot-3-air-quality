  SDS011:
    name: SDS011
    manufacturer: Nova Fitness
    description: |
      This is the specification for the SDS011. One should not consider all those values for granted as there is quite often a big difference
       between what is said to be possible and what is actually possible (and this is why we are setting up all our experiments).
  
        Output: PM2.5, PM10
        Measuring Range: 0.0-999.9μg/m3
        Response Time 1 second
        Serial Data Output Frequency: 1 time/second
        Particle Diameter Resolution: ≤0.3μm
        Relative Error:10%
        Temperature Range:-20~50°C
      
      Note that the SDS011 humidity working range is 0-70%. Above 70% humidity the readings become unreliable.

  BME280:
    name: BME280
    manufacturer: Bosch
    description: | 
      This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring humidity with ±3% accuracy,
      barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude,
      and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter or better accuracy!

  DHT22:
    name: DHT22
    manufacturer: various
    description: |
      The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure
      the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It's fairly simple to use but requires
      careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using
      our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.
  
      Low cost
      Good for 0-100% humidity readings with 2-5% accuracy
      Good for -40 to 80°C temperature readings ±0.5°C accuracy
      No more than 0.5 Hz sampling rate (once every 2 seconds)

  SHT31:
    name: SHT31
    manufacturer: Sensirion AG
    description: |
      The SHT31-D sensor has an excellent ±2% relative humidity and ±0.3°C accuracy for most uses.

  PMS1003:
    name: PMS1003
    manufacturer: Plantower
    description: | 
      The PMS 1003 Sensor is a recent laser based Air Quality Sensor developped by plantower (chinese name: 攀藤 (pānténg))
      and used inside a numerous number of air quality sensing devices. It is also sometimes refered as HK 5001, or labelled
      under the "oneair" brand, but it is indeed developped and produced by plantower (a Shenzhen based company with office in Beijing).
  
      Measuring range: 0.3 to 1.0, 1.0 ~ 2.5, 2.5 to 10 microns (um)
      Range: 0 ~ 500 ug / m3
      counting accuracy of 50% @ 0.3um, 98% @ ≥0.5 um said the quasi-volume : 0.1 liters (L)
      Response time: ≤10 seconds (s)
