BME280:
  name: BME280
  manufacturer: Bosch
  description: | 
    This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring humidity with ±3% accuracy,
    barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuraccy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy. Because pressure changes with altitude,
    and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter or better accuracy!

PMS1003:
  name: PMS1003
  manufacturer: Plantower
  description: | 
    The PMS 1003 Sensor is a recent laser based Air Quality Sensor developped by plantower (chinese name: 攀藤 (pānténg))
    and used inside a numerous number of air quality sensing devices. It is also sometimes refered as HK 5001, or labelled
    under the "oneair" brand, but it is indeed developped and produced by plantower (a Shenzhen based company with office in Beijing).

    Measuring range: 0.3 to 1.0, 1.0 ~ 2.5, 2.5 to 10 microns (um)
    Range: 0 ~ 500 ug / m3
    counting accuracy of 50% @ 0.3um, 98% @ ≥0.5 um said the quasi-volume : 0.1 liters (L)
    Response time: ≤10 seconds (s)
