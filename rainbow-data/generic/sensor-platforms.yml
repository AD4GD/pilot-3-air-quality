  PlumeFlow2:
    name: PlumeFlow2
    manufacturers:
      - plume-labs
    description: |
      The Plume Labs Flow 2 is a wearable air quality sensor that provides real-time measurements of particulate matter (PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM­10) mass concentrations, VOC and NO2 concentrations. Data can be visualized and exported using the phone application for Android and iPhone via Bluetooth.
      We created Flow to answer a question: “what is in the air I breathe.” In the spring of 2023 we made the tough decision to dedicate this knowledge, system, and tech to advancing research, raising awareness, and fostering action. As a result Flow and Flow 2 are no longer for sale.
