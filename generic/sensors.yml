  SDS011:
    name: SDS011
    manufacturers:
      - nova-fitness
    description: |
      This is the specification for the SDS011. One should not consider all those values for granted as there is quite often a big difference
       between what is said to be possible and what is actually possible (and this is why we are setting up all our experiments).
  
        Output: PM2.5, PM10
        Measuring Range: 0.0-999.9μg/m3
        Response Time 1 second
        Serial Data Output Frequency: 1 time/second
        Particle Diameter Resolution: ≤0.3μm
        Relative Error:10%
        Temperature Range:-20~50°C
      
      Note that the SDS011 humidity working range is 0-70%. Above 70% humidity the readings become unreliable.

  DHT22:
    name: DHT22
    description: |
      The DHT22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure
      the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed). It's fairly simple to use but requires
      careful timing to grab data. The only real downside of this sensor is you can only get new data from it once every 2 seconds, so when using
      our library, sensor readings can be up to 2 seconds old.

      Low cost
      Good for 0-100% humidity readings with 2-5% accuracy
      Good for -40 to 80°C temperature readings ±0.5°C accuracy
      No more than 0.5 Hz sampling rate (once every 2 seconds)
